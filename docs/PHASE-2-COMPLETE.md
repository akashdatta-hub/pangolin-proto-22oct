## 🚀 What's Working Now

### Full User Journey Tracking
1. ✅ User opens app → `language_set` event
2. ✅ User clicks story → `story_started` event
3. ✅ User navigates pages → `screen_view` events
4. ✅ User views challenges → `challenge_view` events
5. ✅ User opens hint → `challenge_hint_opened` event
6. ✅ User closes hint → `challenge_hint_completed` event
7. ✅ User completes story → `story_completed` event
8. ✅ User earns badges → `badge_earned` events
9. ✅ User starts vocab test → `vocab_test_started` event
10. ✅ User answers questions → `vocab_question_answered` events
11. ✅ User completes vocab test → `vocab_test_completed` event
12. ✅ User reaches end → `app_completed` event

### Language Tracking
- ✅ Initial language selection tracked
- ✅ Language switches tracked with count
- ✅ All events include current language context

### Vocabulary Test Tracking

- ✅ Every answer tracked (question number + result)
- ✅ Test completion tracked with final score
- ✅ Score stored for app completion tracking

### Hint System Tracking
- ✅ Hint opens tracked with challenge ID
- ✅ Hint completions tracked

## ⏳ Optional Enhancement: Challenge Lifecycle

The foundation is 100% complete. If you want granular challenge tracking:

### What's Ready (Methods exist, just need hooking up):
- `trackChallengeStarted(challengeId, type, number, isRevisit)`
- `trackChallengeSubmitted(challengeId, attemptNumber, result, timeMs)`
- `trackChallengeCompleted(challengeId, result, isRetry)`
- `trackChallengeSkipped(challengeId, attemptsUsed, reason)`
- `trackChallengeRevisited(challengeId)`
- `trackStarCollected(challengeId, starNumber)`

### Where to Add:
See `docs/IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md` for detailed code examples for each challenge component.

### Benefits:
- Per-challenge completion rates
- Average attempts per challenge
- Time spent per challenge
- Revisit success rates
- Challenge skip reasons

**Current Status:** Not required for basic analytics. Can be added later if needed.

## 📈 Microsoft Clarity Setup

Now that code is complete, follow these steps:

### 1. Wait for Data (24 hours recommended)
Data should start flowing immediately, but dashboards/funnels work best with 24 hours of data.

### 2. Set Up Dashboards
Follow the complete guide: `docs/CLARITY-DASHBOARD-SETUP.md`

**Create:**
- 7 Filters (story completions, failures, switchers, etc.)
- 6 Segments (English/Telugu/Hindi users, etc.)
- 2 Funnels (Story Journey, Vocab Test)
- 3 Dashboards (Overview, Challenge Performance, Language)
- 6 Heatmap URLs

### 3. Answer Key Questions
Once dashboards are live, you can answer:
1. What % complete the full story?
2. Which language is most popular?
3. Do users complete vocab test after story?
4. What's the average vocab test score?
5. Do users switch languages during gameplay?
6. Are there any JavaScript errors?
7. What's the badge earning rate?
8. Where do users click on each page?

## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Using Clarity
1. **Recordings** - Watch real user sessions to see confusion
2. **Heatmaps** - Find dead clicks (non-interactive elements)
3. **Funnels** - Identify where users drop off
4. **Filters** - Compare successful vs struggling users
5. **Segments** - Analyze by language for cultural patterns

### For Analysis
1. Focus on drop-off points first
2. Watch low-performer recordings to find issues
3. Compare Telugu vs Hindi users for localization insights
4. Track vocab test scores to measure learning
5. Monitor language switch behavior

### For Iteration
1. Fix highest-impact issues first (most drop-offs)
2. A/B test changes if possible
3. Monitor before/after metrics
4. Iterate weekly based on data
